# Team 8 - Pavel, Cedrick and Ian

## Description

As a user, I'd like to track all my expenses and be able to see them for every month, so I know where my money is going each month.

As a poor collage student with 3 part time jobs, I'd like to track my income for each month, so I know what I can afford.

As an impulse buyer, I'd like to make a budget so I can check how much money I have for the month before impulse buying.
